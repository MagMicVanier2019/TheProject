                             About Me
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My name is Michael Magahey, Ever since I was in grade 5 I've messed
around with programming. I originally started by making basic form
designs in Visual Studio, however, my father soon pushed me to actually
add some functionality to my programs. After a couple of years, I could
write some basic programs in VB.Net. After a few more years, I entered Mr.Sze's
Computer Science class (Grade 10) and started programming with turing.
This was great fun, but it lacked the "cool" factor so I only did ok in the
class. The next year, I was back for grade 11 and Mr.Sze asked me if I
wanted to study Python on by own instead of Pascal. I said yes and began
studying on my own. While I was studying python, I kept practicing more
and more until I began to make my own applications that I use at home.
After I had finished grade 11, I began studying C# due to its functionallity
with Windows Forms. This would allow me to create nice GUIs using Visual Studio
which would not be easy with python (you could use the Windows API but...).
Now I look forward to working on this project with my friend Ainafee.

I first want to move to the US and work in the Silicon Vally (On Security). 
After a few years, I want to start a company with Ainafee and build it up. 
After it is big enough, I wish to sell my stake in the company and work for 
Elon Musks "Neuralink". My overall life goal is to perfect Digital Immortality
and create a digital Heaven.

                    What I like best about programming
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Staying up until 3 am, in the dark, writing a massive program and testing it.
I absolutely love writing the whole thing out and watching it slowly come to
completion.

                   What I like least about programming
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I dislike making proposals, I find that they are so limiting because you can't
add anything outside the proposal. If you have extra time, why wouldn't you add
the the functionallity? I dont understand the logic behind that.
